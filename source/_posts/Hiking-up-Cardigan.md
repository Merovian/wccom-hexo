### I went up a mountain
and came down in the dark. It sounds a lot more hard-core than it really was. Be that as it may, I had a good time, and took some pictures.

I've been working toward two particular things simultaneously this year: improved physical health, and improved mental health. Toward the latter goal I have been trying to keep a regular meditation practice and I'm doing now a third deep dive into Buddhist philosophy. This time I'm focussing on Chan/Zen Buddhism, and it's been going well. I'm hesitant to call it a "mental health" endeavor, since I'm not sure I'm coming at this from the angle of wanting my hand held and to be told everything will get better, which I think is why quite a lot of people start hunting around for a religion. Rather I am looking for something that can be both philosophically rigorous while having a practical component. I could just as well be building a cabin by a lake, in a sense. Or chopping wood, carrying water.

All that said, I've been trying to involve myself in the local Zen center, which sounds like an odd way to put it. But if you've ever tried to join a group as an adult without already having a friend in that group, you might understand the sentiment. I do feel like I'm just sort of barging in and involving myself unnecessarily. I'm trying to get over that inner awkwardness. I have no idea if there is outward awkwardness: I assume there is.

Recently, the lay monk who leads the zendo invited folks to join him for a hike up Mt. Cardigan in New Hampshire. I've never been, and in fact I haven't really been Hiking (capital H) in a very long time. What an excellent time to test my latest attempts at physical health. Do I have any endurance yet?

The answer is "Not Especially" but since the hike only took an hour, and was only moderately difficult with some rock scrambles and only a few steeper inclines near the top, I made it without really suffering too much extra and I got to sit on top of the mountain and watch the sun set. And then hike down in the dark.

It's a well delineated, heavily travelled trail, and there were a lot of people going down at once, most of whom had head lamps (I had an old flashlight in hand). It wasn't easy for me, but it also wasn't particularly difficult. Overall, however, my takeaay is that it was **worth it**.
