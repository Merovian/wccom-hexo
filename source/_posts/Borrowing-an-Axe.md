### This is how it starts
I figured I should start a blog. Here's how it starts, with a borrowed framework
dangling off an old hosting account someone else is using for more profitable
purposes. It is, in it's own way, rather _Thoreauvian_.

Here I will try my best to become something of a proper journal writer or even a personal essayist. Of course, that's what everyone is doing, writing personal essays. Well, me too. I'll start with a collection of really horrible essays while I try my best to power through and (re)gain some skill and facility with this. It certainly isn't going to be pretty at first.

I wonder if I should try other things here as well, like maybe fiction. Time will tell.
